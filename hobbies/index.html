        <section id="volleyball">
          <h3>Volleyball</h3>
          <p>
            I have tried different sports before but volleyball has been my favorite.
            I started playing volleyball when I was in third grade. I had spent most of my
            weekends at a local sports club because I have working parents. Although the
            practices were difficult and tiring at first, I started to enjoy as I played
            more. One thing I like about playing in a team sport is making new friends.
            While I was in a middle school team, I built strong connections with my teammates.
            We spent a lot of time together during practices, and we got to know each other
            well. We still keep in touch after all those years. Unfortunately, I couldn’t
            practice regularly after I started high school. My school didn’t have a volleyball
            team, so I tried to organize school tournaments as much as I can. Although I don’t
            play in a team anymore, I still enjoy playing it as a hobby.

        <section id="painting">
          <h3>Painting</h3>
          <p>
            Painting is my newest hobby. I got into it during the quarantine. My younger sister
            really likes working on art projects and she has a lot of materials. I started
            painting with her paints and brushes. At first she did not want me to “waste”
            them because I am really an amateur. Yet right now we are painting together even
            though I am still not very good at it. She is showing me different techniques to
            make creative paintings. We also paint furnitures and frames together. I can say
            that I improved my relationship with my sister during the quarantine.

        <section id="diy">
          <h3>DIY Projects</h3>
          <p>
            I really enjoy going to the stationery shops. Whenever I go there, I see interesting
            materials from beads to colorful hot glue sticks. They really interest me in doing
            crafts and DIY projects. The last thing I have made was a shoe storage using
            wooden materials. Other than that, I make bracelets and keychains. I also started
            to customize my backpacks with embroidery. It is a little difficult to use the needles.
            On the other hand, my father and I are working on a larger DIY project. We are building
            a tiny house with a shipping container. It is a slow process but I am excited to see
            the result.

        <section id="gardening">
          <h3>Gardening</h3>
          <p>
            Another hobby I started during quarantine is gardening. Since I live on campus, I don’t
            get to take care of the plants at my house. Staying at home really made me love plants
            more. After 2 weeks of a mandatory quarantine, the first thing I did was going to a
            plant shop. I bought more plants of different kinds and they look very pretty together.
            I planted the big ones in the garden and I keeps the small ones inside the house. I also
            have one in my room and it is my favorite. I heard that the Parlor Palm purifies the air
            so it could be a good one to keep in a bedroom. Taking care of plants is very fun but
            challenging. One of my plants bloomed during summer. It was surprising because I thought
            it was a non-flowering plant. On the other hand, some of my plants are very sensitive.
            They instantly wither when I don’t water them at the right time.

        <section id="books">
          <h3>Books</h3>
          <p>
            Until last year, I never read books as a hobby. Then, I have found a recommended
            reading list on a website and the books seemed quite interesting to me. The list contains
            works of modern European literature. I have started reading the books during the summer
            2019. Most of them are very short but they have fascinating stories that could be real.
            My favorite author is Stefan Zweig. I really like his desciptive narrative style. Zweig
            was a psychologist so he defines the personality of the characters in detail and focuses
            on emotions very well. The reading list consists of 160 books and I have read 19 so far.
            It may take a long time but my goal is to read all of these books. I think anyone can enjoy
            reading a book if they can figure out what they really enjoy reading about.
