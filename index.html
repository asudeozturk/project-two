          I am a third year Computer Science major at Illinois Institute of
          Technology. I am interested in front-end and web application development.
          My interest in science first began when I started doing science projects
          for school. I really enjoyed putting effort into my projects to make them
          stand out more. Still today, I value adding visual details to my work
          whenever I can. I realized that I could combine my interest in computer
          science and design with front-end development.

          I am originally from Istanbul, Turkey. Istanbul was once capital of Roman,
          Byzantine, and Ottoman Empires. I grew up visiting historically diverse
          landscapes around the city. I still like traveling and learning about different
          cultures. Technically, I have lived on four continents so far. I had the chance to
          spend two years in Egypt. It was really fun to visit the Great Pyramids and listen
          to interesting stories about ancient times while I was there. Later, I came to the
          U.S. when I was 14 and I’m trying to live on my own since then. My goal was to get
          an education and expand my worldview at the same time. I went to high school in
          NYC and now I am in Chicago for college. Although it is not easy to adapt to
          different places, I find it interesting to meet new people from different backgrounds.
          I enjoy exploring a city by getting lost. We have this debate in my home country:
          “Who knows more: a traveler, or a reader?” I was not sure of the answer so I decided
          to go with both. I believe it is a wonderful experience to travel and study at the
          same time.
